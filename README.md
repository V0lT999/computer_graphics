## My labs in the discipline of computer graphics

### lab1: Research of mathematical methods for representation and transformation of graphic objects on the plane and in space.
Task: Displaying a three-dimensional body relative to coordinate planes.</h3>
      
### lab2: Forming various curves using orthogonal design on the visualization plane (display screen)
Task: Form a b-spline curve of various degrees on the plane(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) based on 7 non-repeating set points. Provide editing of coordinates of the set points with redrawing of the spline.
           
### lab3: Formation of various surfaces using its spatial rotation and orthogonal projection on the plane when it is visualized (displayed on the display screen)
Task: Form a bilinear surface based on an arbitrary set of its four corner points. Ensure that it rotates relative to the X and y axes.

### lab4: Research of algorithms for cutting off segments and polygons with Windows of various types
Task: Provide implementation of a simple algorithm for clipping an array of arbitrary segments with a specified rectangular window. An array of segments should be formed using a random number generator. First, you should display all the generated segments on the screen, and then the ones that fall completely or partially in the window area in a different color or brightness.

### lab5: Research of algorithms for detecting the visibility of complex scenes
Task: Provide implementation of an algorithm for detecting visible faces and edges for a single convex three-dimensional body.

### lab6: Creating realistic images using simple lighting models with one or two point sources.
Task: Implement a ray tracing algorithm for creating a complex scene.
