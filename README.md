## My labs in the discipline of computer graphics

### lab1: Research of mathematical methods for representation and transformation of graphic objects on the plane and in space.
      </h3> Task: Displaying a three-dimensional body relative to coordinate planes.</h3>
      
### lab2: Forming various curves using orthogonal design on the visualization plane (display screen)
      Task: Form a b-spline curve of various degrees on the plane(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) based on 7 non-repeating set points. 
            Provide editing of coordinates of the set points with redrawing of the spline.
